	<description>Vanilla Apparel Expanded - Accessories is a new installment in the Vanilla Expanded series. This time, our sight fell onto the accessories system, which is quite heavily limited in vanilla game. Smokepop belt, or Shield belt - these are your only choices. Are you rich enough to sport Royalty in your game? You MIGHT be able to build jet packs too! And Broadshield generators.

Again, limited, isn’t it? Hence, we have decided it’s time to spice things up, and add some new equipment items for all technological eras of Rimworld - but as you all know, simply ‘adding X to Y skill’ isn’t the usual way we pick - therefor we tried to keep the bonuses and utility applications as varied as possible.

Your tribal archers will now be twice as efficient with quivers, while your construction crews will carry belts with tools to speed up work. Your military commandos might find themselves a new shoulder mounted friend, and if you’re lucky and ballsy enough to do quests, a resurrector belt will literally stop your pawn from dying.

Vanilla Apparel Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Weapons Expanded and Vanilla Armours Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.</description>
